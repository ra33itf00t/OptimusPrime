# The art of farts ; a.k.a fenn el tiesh.

Pro tip ; Don't break spells, leverage the living fuck out of em.

It's a spell ffs, don't be afraid of it, mine it,
fortunately for me I had two spells, one light the other dark.
yes it's a fucked up process & blablabla....etc,
just hear me out :
if you were 80 years old &&
you were aware of what many aren't &&
you were in a position to care about what many don't because "they" have no choice but not to ; the burden of life's predicaments is a mighty weight on everyone ;

what would you rather do ? seem nuts & extract "l'ecume du tumulte" for a greater purpose : cave in just because it's a "crazy" thing to do.

The fucks un/given will be relegated to the yet another strata of human experience ; a gift for those present, an homage to those past & a wonder for those still to come.

How I do what I do is my business, the whole point is encapsulation, a glimpse behind the wizard's curtain may shock some innocent souls but believe you me I've seen, been subject to, guilty of indulging in & am fully aware of far darker means that the very scum of this earth use & abuse constantly & continuously to maintain the upper hand, it's addiction induced spiritual imbalance & there I was with a shit ton of dynamite laying everywhere, fuck it blow it up.
level the playing field with a supernova,
dig a trench first sure.

Threat : We have demons.
Me : We have a shmoo.

My hope is that it will be worthwhile.
I'll do my very best, as for the rest,
We'll have to see how it plays out.
May you live long and prosper.
