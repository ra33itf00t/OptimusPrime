# Your mustache was more pronounced than mine anyway,
# The cutest shmoo ever.
Actually I wished I could tell you all these things just so you could see how beautiful you are, so you could see yourself through my eye, that's when I learned what having a daughter would feel like, what it would do to me, alas at the same time little did I know that was because I missed a crucial piece, a pillar ; Fatherhood, call me insane, I don't mind, I saw a facet of life that gave me enough juice to carry on, so that maybe someday I'd have one of my own and be as happy to have her, I knew then and there what it meant, I needed that feeling again, so I could paint the walls of my tomb with that ancient color, violet springs.
