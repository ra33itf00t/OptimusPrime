# Your mustache was more pronounced than mine anyway,
# The cutest shmoo ever.
Actually I wished I could tell you all these things just so you could see how beautiful you are, so you could see yourself through my eye, that's when I learned what having a daughter would feel like, what it would do to me, alas at the same time little did I know that was because I missed a crucial piece, a pillar ; Fatherhood, call me insane, I don't mind, I saw a facet of life that gave me enough juice to carry on, so that maybe someday I'd have one of my own and be as happy to have her, I knew then and there what it meant, I needed that feeling again, so I could paint the walls of my tomb with that ancient color, violet springs & hopefully you'd paint your memory of youself at that age thinking ; If indeed that was possible, you'd remember yourself as I saw it & I'd reach the open state of mind I was in at that time, which was in part signigicantly thanks to you, a fair trade in the short term, a debt in the long one, on my part.
